# Introduction  
This project introduces ADVisionGNN, an innovative approach to unsupervised industrial anomaly detection, leveraging a **Vision Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder**. The architecture combines reconstruction-based techniques with distance-based methods for detecting anomalies with high precision.  

Although still under development, this framework aims to improve anomaly detection in industrial settings by providing robust and scalable methods for identifying irregularities.

# Proposed Architecture  

## Training Process  
- The **encoder** is designed to extract meaningful feature maps from input data. These features are stored in a **memory bank** built exclusively from normal samples, ensuring accurate anomaly detection.  
- The **decoder** focuses on reconstructing the feature maps back into the original image, facilitating anomaly identification.

## Inferring Process  
- The decoder's reconstruction is utilized to compute a **global anomaly score**, identifying regions of abnormality.  
- An **enhanced feature map** is generated by upscaling and assigning pixel-level anomaly scores.  
- The global anomaly score and pixel-level score map are **combined** to produce the final anomaly detection result.
